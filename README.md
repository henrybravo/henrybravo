# Hi there! :thumbsup:

I am Henry Bravo, an experienced IT professional (ex-AWS). Here :rocket: at :octocat: github you will find work used for projects at AWS and its customers, and I also have stuff at [gitlab/henrybravo](https://gitlab.com/henrybravo). So check those repos too for more example solutions related to cloud development, and on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) :cloud:
