# Hi there! :thumbsup:

I am Henry Bravo, an experienced IT professional (ex-AWS) running an international consultancy practice (called Bravo IT) in Europe :rocket:. Here at :octocat: github you will find work used for demonstrations, experiments, poc's and (former) projects while working at AWS and the customers at the time. I also work on stuff that is hosted at [gitlab/henrybravo](https://gitlab.com/henrybravo). So check out those repos too for more example solutions related to cloud development, recently on Azure and mostly on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) :cloud:
